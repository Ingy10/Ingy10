# Hi there, I'm Kyle Ingham ðŸ‘‹

## About Me

I'm a passionate and driven software developer with a strong foundation in problem-solving, analytical thinking, and continuous learning. My journey began in competitive sports, where I developed a deep appreciation for discipline and skill-building. Over time, my interests evolved from the physical to the technical, leading me to pursue software development as a career.

I hold a **Diploma in Software Engineering from BrainStation, Canada**, where I built several full-stack applications and honed my expertise in modern web technologies. I also completed an intensive **16-week Data Science and Analytics program with M2M Tech**, solidifying my ability to work with data-driven applications.

Recently, I **completed a 3-month paid internship as a Software Developer at Infonancial**, a fin-tech company specializing in **Loan Origination Software 2.0**. During this internship, I independently built the entire **Configurations section** of the LOS 2.0 platform, resolved numerous bugs, and optimized the system while collaborating closely with the development team. I actively participated in **agile stand-ups (3x per week)** and managed tasks using **JIRA** for efficient project tracking.

Currently, my focus is on developing a **Wine Database Knowledge and Management App** designed for restaurants. This app will help train staff on the wine list and provide quick access to essential wine details, enabling them to confidently enhance the guest experience and drive wine sales.

Beyond coding, I am passionate about **surfing, snowboarding, and exploring the outdoors**. These experiences have broadened my perspective and reinforced my adaptabilityâ€”an essential skill in software development.

## Education

I recently completed a Diploma in Software Engineering at BrainStation, Canada, where I developed full-stack applications, including my capstone project, *Food Market*. This app helps users compare grocery store prices to market averages, leveraging CPI data from Canadian provinces and allowing users to track their grocery expenses.

Afterward, I completed a 16-week Data Science and Analytics program with M2M Tech in Calgary, which culminated in an industry-led project. This program helped me combine my coding skills with data analysis, further enhancing my technical and analytical abilities.

Before BrainStation, I studied Economics at Brock University, where I developed a strong foundation in data analysis and market dynamics.
